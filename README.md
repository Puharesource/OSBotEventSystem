# OSBotEventSystem
A proper event system for OSBot.

I mainly made this because I saw a friend of mine make bots for OSRS using OSBot.
I saw the way that the majority of scripts were made and highly disliked it.

This is why I've decided to make a simply but expandable event system,
that allows you to subscribe to certain events (these events have to be made manually, as I don't make scripts myself).

## Examples
If there's a need for a more indepth tutorial, I'll make one, but for the time being have a look at the test directory:
